# Umbra Yurei Homebrew Tap

This repository hosts the `umbra-yurei/brew` tap for distributing Umbra Yurei CLI binaries through Homebrew. Use this tap to install prerelease or custom tooling that is not available in the core Homebrew repositories.

## Usage

Add the tap and install the `cruma-tunnel` formula:

```bash
brew tap umbra-yurei/homebrew-repo
brew install uumbra-yurei/homebrew-repo/cruma-tunnel
```
